Poet Introduction:
G. Rafael Keerthan is a reflective poet whose writing blends emotion, imagination, and quiet wisdom. Drawn to themes of nature, nostalgia, humanity, and inner awakening, his poems often explore the delicate spaces between silence and meaning. With a gentle yet questioning voice, he transforms ordinary elements—rain, earth, stars—into symbols of love, responsibility, and hope. His work carries sincerity, sensitivity, and thoughtful depth, inviting readers not just to read, but to feel, pause, and reflect.
